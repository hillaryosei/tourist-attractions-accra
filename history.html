                <p>Accra is the capital of Ghana, with an estimated population of 4.2 million as of 2020. Accra comes
                    from the Akan word “Nkran” meaning ants. This refers to the many anthills found in the countryside
                    surrounding Accra. Many languages are spoken in Accra, the main ones being Akan/Twi, Ga, and of
                    course English. Accra became a prominent trading center, used by the Dutch, Portuguese, French, and
                    Danes who built many forts in the city. The British gained control of the in 1877.
                    Post-independence, in 1957, the 1st President Kwame Nkrumah built landmarks to encourage pride and
                    nationalism to the Ghanaian and African diasporas.</p>
