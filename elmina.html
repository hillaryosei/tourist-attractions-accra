        <p>Elmina Castle was built by the Portuguese in 1482 and was named Castelo de São Jorge da Mina (trans. St.
          George of the Mine Castle). It was the first trading post on the Gulf of Guinea. The castle later became one
          of the most important stops on the Atlantic slave trade route. The Dutch seized control of the fort from the
          Portuguese in 1637, and took over all of the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1642. The slave trade continued under
          the Dutch until 1814. In 1872, all of the Dutch Gold Coast was seized by Great Britain. Now, Elmina Castle is
          recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</p>
