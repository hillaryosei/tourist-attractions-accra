        <p>The Park & Mausoleum is dedicated to the 1st President of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah and is the site where he
          officially declared Ghana’s independence. It was built in 1992. The mausoleum was designed by Don Arthur and harbors the
          bodies of both Kwame Nkrumah and his wife Fathia Nkrumah. The building is meant to represent an upside-down
          sword, the Akan people’s symbol of peace. The mausoleum has a black star at the
          top to represent unity. The mausoleum is surrounded by water, to symbolize life.</p>
